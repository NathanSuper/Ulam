# Ulam
Program challenge I saw online, This is my take of it



older readme:
Ulam

This is a program to demonstrate a property of number spirals. That is their tendency
to have Prime numbers moving along certain diagonal axis.

So far i just have the spiral printer working with an int array. That is the first part
The next step is to have the sprial array be of a new "number type". this new type will include 
information on if it is prime or not. 

The 3rd stage is just a real time rendering/animation of the process


A hypothetical 4th step is output all the information from the arrays to create an image showing 
the patterns on a much larger scale than that which could be display by a terminal.
